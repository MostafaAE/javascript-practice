# Mapty

An app that allows users to mark their workouts on a map by clicking on their workout location, and filling a form with their workout type (running, cycling) and details, and the app will put markers on the map displaying all the different user workouts details so the user can keep a record of all his workouts details (location, date, distance, duration, cadence, and elevation gain).
